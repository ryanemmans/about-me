      <h2>A Jack of Many Trades, a Wearer of Hats.</h2>
      <h3>(both literally and figuratively)</h3>
      <p>Prior to Code Fellows I was a bartender and manager in Chicago for nearly a decade, specializing in craft
        cocktails and high volume. I was very fortunate to be a part of some teams at highly regarded, award-winning
        establishments. I took on leadership roles where I created systems, assisted in operations, and trained new
        staff.</p>

      <p>The unfortunate result of Covid-19 closing everything down led me to move to Seattle with my partner and our
        two cats to pursue a career change into software engineering. It's taken some time to get here, but I couldn't
        be more excited for what lies ahead. Up to this point, my coding knowledge is fairly rudimentary with a
        reasonable understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS, but my Javascript experience is quite limited and the
        backend is completely foreign territory, so I’m considering myself as starting from scratch.</p>

      <p>My education background is in cabinetmaking and furniture design. In addition to pulling long hours in the
        service industry, I have simultaneously done work in both residential and commercial finish carpentry. I am
        passionate about all things design related, and hope to apply my love for aesthetics in my new profession. I
        love to ride bikes and go hiking in my free time, and am constantly trying to learn new things on just about any
        random subject.</p>

      <p>My primary goal at the moment is to get all the way through Code Fellows and pass 401 with flying colors. I
        anticipate the challenge of a lifetime accompanied by repeated failures, frustrations, and moments of sheer
        exhaustion, but I'm going to give it my all while somehow maintaining my self care. (Should be interesting!) I'm
        really looking forward to further connecting with my cohort-mates and building my network in a new field and new
        city. Let's do this!</p>
